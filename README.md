# Off-by-one Error in Java Array Loop

This repository demonstrates a common off-by-one error in Java when iterating over arrays. The error occurs when the loop index goes beyond the valid range of the array, leading to an `ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException`.

The `bug.java` file contains the code with the error. The `bugSolution.java` file provides the corrected code.

This example highlights the importance of carefully checking loop conditions when working with arrays in Java.
